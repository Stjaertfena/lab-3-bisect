# Lab 3 - Hunting bugs
Debugging comes in two different shapes:
- It's either the day-to-day activities that gets done during regular development, in isolated topic branches, where bugs are found and fixed instantly, before being integrated in the general code base...
- ...or it's the more high-octane work related to ironing out bugs that have snuck all the way into production.

The latter generally calls for more of a Sherlock Holmes approach in order to both identify and fix the issue; after all, it’s made it all the way to production!

In this exercise we'll be focusing on the latter of the two, and see how `bisect` can be used to identify in which commit a bug was originally introduced. We'll finish of by looking at how a fix then can be integrated and published to production.
